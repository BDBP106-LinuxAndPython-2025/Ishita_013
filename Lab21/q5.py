"""Write a function that takes two numbers n1 and n2 and an operator description such
as add, subtract etc. Depending on the operation, perform the operation. Raise a
ValueError if the operator is not an arithmetic operation such as add, subtract, mul-
tiplication or division. Catch the ValueError and ZeroDivisionError and print the
appropriate messages. In the finally block, print a completion message. Call this func-
tion with different scenarios to test the above exceptions. Take screenshots of the output
while uploading your labs to GitHub."""
