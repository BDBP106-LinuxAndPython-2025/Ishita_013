# (3) How are packages different from modules? How are modules different from functions, and how are methods different from functions?
"""Package: A directory containing __init__.py and multiple modules (files)
Module: A single Python file (script) or compiled file that can be imported
Function: A reusable block of code, defined by "def" or "lambda"
Method: A function that belongs to an object (e.g., class instance)"""

# Example:
"""File structure:
mypackage/
  __init__.py
   module1.py
 module1.py can have functions and classes:
 def func(): pass
 class MyClass:
     def method(self): pass"""
