#What does the command set ("letters") do? Explain
s = set("letters")
print(s)
#by this we can tell that set removes any extra or repeated letters or items in a string
#The set() function creates a set from an iterable
#Sets contain only UNIQUE elements (no duplicates) and the order is not preserved in sets
